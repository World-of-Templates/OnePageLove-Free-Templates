Usage
-----

_This is still under development. For better instructions, head over to the [project website](https://evie.undraw.co)._

This version contains the development setup, with the source files (SASS,EJS) and a Gulp/Express.js setup. To use it, run `gulp`. This will start the server with live reloading. If you just want to compile a customized production version, the path is "src/theme/" and there you can change the SASS files, customize colors, make any change you want and run `gulp build`. This will generate a "theme" folder which contains your static website.
